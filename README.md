# dev-toolbox
> A curated list of useful tools for those just getting started with Web Development.  This is by no means a list of everything you need to know, nor is it exhaustive. Merely a collection of tools &amp; resources we have found to be useful while on the development path.

## Education Resources

## Basic Toolbox - Items you're likely to use everyday
